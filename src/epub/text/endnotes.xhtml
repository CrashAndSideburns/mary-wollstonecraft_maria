    <ol>
        <li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote"><p>A more copious extract of this letter is subjoined to the author’s preface. <a href="preface-1.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote"><p>The part communicated consisted of the first fourteen chapters. <a href="preface-1.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote"><p>A blank space about ten characters in length occurs here in the original edition [Publisher’s note]. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote"><p>The copy which had received the author’s last corrections breaks off in this place, and the pages which follow, to the end of Chap. IV, are printed from a copy in a less finished state. [Godwin’s note] <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote"><p>The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of Maria in a former instance, appears to have been an after-thought of the author. This has occasioned the omission of any allusion to that circumstance in the preceding narration. EDITOR. [Godwin’s note] <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote"><p>The copy which appears to have received the author’s last corrections, ends at this place. [Godwin’s note] <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote"><p>The manuscript is imperfect here. An episode seems to have been intended, which was never committed to paper. EDITOR. [Godwin’s note] <a href="chapter-9.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote"><p>In the original edition the paragraph following is preceded by three lines of asterisks [Publisher’s note]. <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote"><p>The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of Maria, in an early stage of the history, is already stated (Chap. III.) to have been an after-thought of the author. This has probably caused the imperfectness of the manuscript in the above passage; though, at the same time, it must be acknowledged to be somewhat uncertain, whether Darnford is the stranger intended in this place. It appears from Chap. XVII, that an interference of a more decisive nature was designed to be attributed to him. EDITOR. [Godwin’s note] <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote"><p>Two and a half lines of asterisks appear here in the original [Publisher’s note]. <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote"><p>Presumed to have been written by Godwin [Publisher’s note]. <a href="appendix.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-12" epub:type="endnote"><p>Two and a half lines of dashes follow here in the original [Publisher’s note]. <a href="chapter-15.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote"><p>The name in the manuscript is by mistake written Caesar. EDITOR. [Godwin’s note] <a href="chapter-16.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-14" epub:type="endnote"><p>i.e., Godwin [Publisher’s note]. <a href="conclusion.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-15" epub:type="endnote"><p>To understand these minutes, it is necessary the reader should consider each of them as setting out from the same point in the story, viz. the point to which it is brought down in the preceding chapter. [Godwin’s note] <a href="conclusion.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
        <li id="note-16" epub:type="endnote"><p>See author’s preface. [Godwin’s note] <a href="conclusion.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p></li>
